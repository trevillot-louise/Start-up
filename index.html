		    <h1>Our idea :</h1>
		    <p>Language Network is a dual purpose online platform. It allows teachers to post and give paid or free language lessons. Furthermore, users from all over the world can communicate via an instant messaging box in order to learn about the country, language, culture, etc. In addition to having an educational aspect of teaching, the platform can allow workers, students, tourists to learn about a country before going there. Do you need information, do you want to learn a language or just quench your curiosity? Language Network is for you.




		    </p>
		
		    <h2>How to choose?</h2>
		    <p>Verified teachers can post audio or written content to their page in order to progress in a language. It is possible for them to give paid lessons live to a limited number of students. Pricing is free. Instant messaging takes the form of a chat channel with other users. Chatbots are also made available to answer basic questions about a chosen country (currency, basic language use, weather, cultural elements, etc.). This free format offers several options and responds to a main objective: information and progress.
